# InternetProtests.com
The Internet Protests Site code

## Current Protest:
Australian Government AABill encryption backdoors

Please use the IP List to redirect all traffic to your webserver to "internetprotests.com"; if all traffic is redirected from as many servers as we can get, they are likely to repeal the law.
Please use the Email list to bounce all emails from these domains with the bounce message; "Protesting AABill - see InternetProtests.com"

Feel free to USE the iplist and/or email addresses to have your own custom protest page; the main idea is to present a unified front.
