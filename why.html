<h2>Why the site </h2><br><br>
<div class="body">

    I am not an Australian, however things that occur in other countries which affect the internet affect us all.  <br>
    <ul><li>I have many friends in many nations, including Australia
        <li>I know several programmers in Australia that this can affect, and the ramifications are scary for them
        <li>I actually do business in Australia
        <li>This sets the precedent for other countries to do the same thing
        </ul>

    If we don't stop government encroachment when/where we can, it will affect us all in every country.

    The idea behind this site is to cause the government as much pain as they are proposing to cause the internet.  <br>
    They are supposed to be listening to their constituents, and when they choose not to, the constituents really need to show them who is in charge.<br>
    Backdoors are not good for anyone; broken encryption is extremely bad for everyone.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As many sites as we can get; redirects all AU government traffic to a notice page about why. (feel free to redirect locally or to this site)
        <li>As many email servers as we can get; bounces all email address that end with government emails.
        <li>I would really love it if Apple, Microsoft, Google all bounced both mail and web connections from the AU government.
        <li>If you are hosting an AU government website (Amazon, Cloudflare, Fastly); you might consider sending them a notice that you will be dropping them as clients by Dec 31st if the law is not repealed.
        <li>If you are contacted to host an AU government website; let them know you can't do to the AABill.</li>
        <li>If you control the routing tables; seriously route all the gov IPs to null routes.
        <li>If you work in the government IT department, you know you can accidentally route all traffic here.  :-D
        <li>If you work for any internet providers; I would really love to have the IP addresses of the homes of the Senators and Representatives; when their family start giving them a hard time you know it will change.
        <li>Bonus points for each Senator and/or Representative, and any of their personal businesses IP addresses -- the more pain THEY feel personally the more likely they will decide it isn't worth it to try and thwart the will of the people.</li>
      </ul>

    The idea is this affects the ability for any part of the AU government to get anything done, if we can cause a major issue to the entire AU government; it will have to rethink its desire to damage the world wide internet.
