<h2>Why the site </h2><br><br>
<div class="body">

    I am not an Australian, however things that occur in other countries that effect the internet effect us all.  <br>
    <ul><li>I have many friends in many nations, including Australia
        <li>I know several programmers in Australia that this can effect, and it is scary for them the ramifications.
        <li>I actually do business in Australia
        <li>This sets the president for other countries to do the same thing.
        </ul>

    If we don't stop government encroachment when/where we can, it will effect us all in every country.

    The idea behind this site is to cause the government as much pain as they are proposing to cause the internet.  <br>
    They are supposed to be listening to their constituents; and when they choose not to; then the constituents really need to show them who is in charge.<br>
    Backdoors are not good for anyone; broken encryption is extremely bad for everyone.
    <ul>
        <li>As many sites as we can get; redirects all AU government traffic to a notice page about why. (feel free to redirect locally or to this site)
        <li>As many email servers as we can get; bounces all email address that end with government emails.
        <li>I would really love it if Apple, Microsoft, Google all bounced both mail and web connections from the AU government.
        <li>If you are hosting a AU government website (Amazon, Cloudflare, Fastly); you might consider sending them a notice that you will be dropping them as clients by Dec 31st if the law is not repealed.
        <li>If you are contacted to host a AU government website; let them know you can't do to the AABill.</li>
        <li>If you control the routing tables; seriously route all the gov ip's to null routes.
        <li>If you work in the government IT department, you know you can accidentally route all traffic here.  :-D
        <li>If you work in customer service for any internet providers; I would really love to have their IP addresses of the homes of the Senators and Representatives; when their wife and kids start giving them a hard time you know it will change.
        <li>If you are friends of any of the senators or reps; see if you can get the ip address, connect to there network and go to whatsmyip.com.</li>
      </ul>

    The idea is this effects the ability for any part of the AU government to get anything done, if we can cause a major issue to the entire AU government; it will have to rethink its desire to damage the world wide internet.
