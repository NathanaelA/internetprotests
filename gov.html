<h2>Government / Why am I here! </h2><br><br>
<div class="body">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do to the fact that the Australian government has decided to vote to damage the world-wide internet, we the internet citizens have routed the Australian government to limit any more damage they can do.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the damage is repaired; all facets of the Australian Government is persona-non-grata on the internet site you attempted to visit.  Since you are a government worker; please contact your supervisor and have them escalate the issue to their bosses.  In addition please contact the offices of your representatives and senators and tell them to repeal the #AABILL because the government is now blocked!
